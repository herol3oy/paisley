A curated collection of insights from experienced technologists, each answering one simple yet profound question:  

**_"What would you improve in your technical domain?"_**

## Inspiration

This project began with a single question I posed on Hacker News about improvements in front-end development. The two responses caught my attention:

> "I've done back end work where I dealt with asynchronous situations with production rules and RETE networks; I'd be interested to see this applied to the front end"

> "I would replace the whole ECMA / Javascript ecosystem with a LISPy model."

[Original discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41490327)  

These unexpected and thought-provoking responses revealed the value of asking experienced technologists what they would change or improve. Every developer, researcher, and engineer has a unique perspective on what could be better in their domain.  

Paisley is a space to share and celebrate these ideas.
