I'm Hamed Sedighi, a front-end developer living in Warsaw, Poland. I came up with this project idea after asking a question on Hacker News about improvements in front-end development.

**_"What tool, technology or process in front-end development would you improve?"_**

The two responses caught my attention:

> "I've done back end work where I dealt with asynchronous situations with production rules and RETE networks; I'd be interested to see this applied to the front end"

> "I would replace the whole ECMA / Javascript ecosystem with a LISPy model."

[Original discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41490327)

These unexpected and thought-provoking responses revealed the value of asking experienced technologists what they would change or improve. Every developer, researcher, and engineer has a unique perspective on what could be better in their domain.

Paisley is a space to share and celebrate these ideas.
